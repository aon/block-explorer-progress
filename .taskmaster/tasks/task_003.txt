# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create API Endpoint for Log Fetching
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement an API endpoint in Astro to fetch logs from the specified Docker container.
# Details:
Create a server-side endpoint in Astro that uses `dockerode` to fetch logs. Use the `since` or `tail` options to limit log retrieval to recent entries. Ensure the endpoint is secure and handles errors gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Test the endpoint by manually calling it and verifying it returns logs from the Docker container.
