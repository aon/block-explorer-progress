# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Log Parsing Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Parse the fetched logs to extract the latest `blockNumber` from structured JSON log entries.
# Details:
Write a function to parse JSON log entries and filter for those containing `blockNumber`. Handle malformed logs with `try-catch` blocks. Extract the most recent `blockNumber` from valid logs.

# Test Strategy:
Test the parsing logic with sample log data, including edge cases like malformed logs.
