# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Docker SDK (dockerode) in Backend
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the Docker SDK (`dockerode`) to interact with the Docker daemon from the backend.
# Details:
The Docker SDK (`dockerode@4.0.7`) has been successfully configured with a comprehensive Docker client utility. Key features include:
- Singleton Docker client using Unix socket
- Environment variable configuration for container name
- Log parsing for block number extraction
- Test API endpoint for verification

Next steps involve testing with real containers and production environment setup.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker connection through the test API endpoint
2. Test container listing and target container detection
3. Validate log parsing and block number extraction
4. Test error handling scenarios
5. Verify production configuration with TLS
