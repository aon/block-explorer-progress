# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Frontend Polling Mechanism
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add auto-refreshing logic to the frontend to poll the API endpoint every 30 seconds.
# Details:
1. Identify the React component responsible for displaying the block number (created in Task 5).
2. Add polling logic using `setInterval` or a library like `SWR`/`React Query` with a `refreshInterval` of 30 seconds to poll the API endpoint.
3. Ensure the polling stops when the component unmounts to prevent memory leaks.

# Test Strategy:
Test the polling by observing the UI updates every 30 seconds and verifying no memory leaks occur.
